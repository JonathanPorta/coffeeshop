JEFRi BUGS To Update in Main Codebase:
jefri.min.js:find() - typo near hasOwnProperty(r.key...blah blah

jefri.min.js:find() - " if (results[spec[r.key]]) {" - Needs to also check for _id like the line above it.

jefri.min.js:expand() - return built array after assigning transaction.entities to built.
